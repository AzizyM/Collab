### Github Tutorials

#### 1. [Learn to Host Files on Github](http://www.labnol.org/internet/free-file-hosting-github/29092/)
        
[GitHub](https://github.com), in simple English, is a website for hosting source code. The site is built for    programmers and, if you are not one, it is highly unlikely that you have ever used Github. Repositories and Forks, the basic building blocks of Github, may seem like second-nature to developers but, for everyone else, Github continues to be a complicated beast.

#### 2. [Github Gists for Non-Developers](http://www.labnol.org/internet/github-gist-tutorial/28499/)

[GitHub](https://github.com) isn’t just a place for developers though. The site can be used a writing platform. It can host HTML websites. You can use Github to visually compare the content of two text files. The site’s Gist service can used for anonymous publishing and as a tasklist. There’re so many [things to do on Github](https://www.labnol.org/internet/github-gist-tutorial/28499/) already and you can how use it as a free file hosting service as well.
